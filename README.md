# Coyote

A hobby operating system.

## How to build and run it?

The OS requires custom toolchain to compile it. Please refer to `./doc/toolchain.md` for the instruction how to build it.

Beside the toolchain and its dependencies you need to have `xorriso` and `qemu` installed on your machine.

Once those are setup, run `./qemu.sh` to build an iso image with the OS and run it with qemu.
